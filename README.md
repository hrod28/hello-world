# hello-world

  My name is Heidi Rodriguez.  I am 36 yrs old.  I am very excited to start this program and I look forward to learning and working with all of my classmates.  My outside interest include riding bikes, arts and crafts, and playing with my dog.

oh, I forgot to mention that I love live music.
